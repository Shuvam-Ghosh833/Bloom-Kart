bcryptjs: A library to help you hash passwords.Password hashing turns your password 
        (or any other piece of data) into a short string of letters and/or numbers using an 
        encryption algorithm. If a website is hacked, password hashing helps prevent cybercriminals
        from getting access to your passwords.

jsonwebtoken:   JSON Web Token (JWT) is a compact, URL-safe means of representing
            claims to be transferred between two parties.  The claims in a JWT
            are encoded as a JSON object that is used as the payload of a JSON
            Web Signature (JWS) structure or as the plaintext of a JSON Web
            Encryption (JWE) structure, enabling the claims to be digitally
            signed or integrity protected with a Message Authentication Code
            (MAC) and/or encrypted.

validator:    This library validates and sanitizes strings only.

nodemailer:   Used to get emails or sms for OTP if Forgot password

cookie-parser:  The middleware will parse the Cookie header on the request and expose 
                the cookie data as the property req.cookies and, if a secret was provided,
                as the property req.signedCookies. These properties are name value pairs
                of the cookie name to cookie value.
